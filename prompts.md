I want to write a smart contract in the Aptos variant of Move language that allows two players to play chess.

I have this code defining the module and some useful structs:
```
module addr::chess01 {
    use std::error;
    use std::option::{Self, Option};
    use std::signer;
    use std::vector;
    use aptos_std::simple_map::{Self, SimpleMap};

    const E_INVALID_MOVE: u64 = 0;
    const E_NOT_YOUR_TURN: u64 = 1;
    const E_GAME_OVER: u64 = 2;

    const KING: u8 = 1;
    const QUEEN: u8 = 2;
    const ROOK: u8 = 3;
    const BISHOP: u8 = 4;
    const KNIGHT: u8 = 5;
    const PAWN: u8 = 6;

    const LEFT: u8 = 255;
    const RIGHT: u8 = 1;
    const UP: u8 = 1;
    const DOWN: u8 = 255;

    struct Piece has store {
        player: u8,
        piece_type: u8,
    }

    struct Board has store {
        board: vector<vector<Option<Piece>>>,
    }

    struct Game has store {
        player1: address,
        player2: address,
        board: Board,
        current_turn: u8,
        game_over: bool,
    }

    struct GameStore has key {
        /// This contains all the games the user has created.
        games: SimpleMap<u32, Game>,

        /// Here we track the next index to use in the above map.
        next_index: u32,
    }
}
```

Don't write any code yet, just let me no with a simple yes / no that you understand.








In this module I have the following function to create a board:
```
// Initialize and create a new board
fun create_board(): Board {
    let board = vector::empty();

    // Create the board with starting positions for Player 1 (0) and Player 2 (1)
    let i = 0;
    while (i < 8) {
        let row = vector::empty();
        let j = 0;
        while (j < 8) {
            vector::push_back(&mut row, option::none());
            j = j + 1;
        };

        if ((i == 0) || (i == 7)) {
            let player;
            if (i == 0) {
                player = 0;
            } else {
                player = 1;
            };
            vector::push_back(&mut row, option::some(Piece { player: player, piece_type: ROOK }));
            vector::push_back(&mut row, option::some(Piece { player: player, piece_type: KNIGHT }));
            vector::push_back(&mut row, option::some(Piece { player: player, piece_type: BISHOP }));
            vector::push_back(&mut row, option::some(Piece { player: player, piece_type: QUEEN }));
            vector::push_back(&mut row, option::some(Piece { player: player, piece_type: KING }));
            vector::push_back(&mut row, option::some(Piece { player: player, piece_type: BISHOP }));
            vector::push_back(&mut row, option::some(Piece { player: player, piece_type: KNIGHT }));
            vector::push_back(&mut row, option::some(Piece { player: player, piece_type: ROOK }));
        } else if ((i == 1) || (i == 6)) {
            let player;
            if (i == 1) {
                player = 0;
            } else {
                player = 1;
            };
            let k = 0;
            while (k < 8) {
                vector::push_back(&mut row, option::some(Piece { player: player, piece_type: PAWN }));
                k = k + 1;
            }
        };

        vector::push_back(&mut board, row);
        i = i + 1;
    };

    Board { board: board }
}
```

In this module I have the following code to create a new game:
```
// Create a new game
public entry fun create_game(player1: &signer, player2: address) {
    // Create the board.
    let board = create_board();

    // Create the game.
    let player1_addr = signer::address_of(player1);

    let game = Game {
        player1: player1_addr,
        player2: player2,
        board: board,
        current_turn: 0,
        game_over: false,
    };

    // Create the GameStore if necessary.
    if (!exists<GameStore>(player1_addr)) {
        let game_store = GameStore { games: simple_map::create(), next_index: 0 };
        move_to(player1, game_store);
    };

    // Add the game to the GameStore.
    let game_store = borrow_global_mut<GameStore>(player1_addr);

    simple_map::add(&mut game_store.games, game_store.next_index, game);
    game_store.next_index = game_store.next_index + 1;
}
```

I have this function that checks whether a rook move is valid:
```
fun is_valid_rook_move(board: &Board, from_x: u8, from_y: u8, to_x: u8, to_y: u8, player: u8): bool {
    // Check if the move is either horizontal or vertical.
    if (from_x != to_x && from_y != to_y) {
        return false
    };

    // Check that the piece is moving.
    if (from_x == to_x && from_y == to_y) {
        return false
    };

    let delta_x = if (from_x > to_x) { from_x - to_x } else { to_x - from_x };
    let delta_y = if (from_y > to_y) { from_y - to_y } else { to_y - from_y };

    let x_step = if (from_x < to_x) { RIGHT } else { LEFT };
    let y_step = if (from_y < to_y) { UP } else { DOWN };

    let current_x = from_x;
    let current_y = from_y;

    let steps_remaining = if (delta_x > delta_y) { delta_x } else { delta_y };

    while (steps_remaining > 0) {
        current_x = if (x_step == RIGHT) { current_x + 1 } else { current_x - 1 };
        current_y = if (y_step == UP) { current_y + 1 } else { current_y - 1 };

        let row = vector::borrow(&board.board, (current_y as u64));
        let piece_opt = vector::borrow(row, (current_x as u64));
        if (option::is_some(piece_opt)) {
            if (current_x == to_x && current_y == to_y) {
                let piece = option::borrow(piece_opt);
                if (piece.player == player) {
                    return false
                };
            } else {
                return false
            };
        };
        steps_remaining = steps_remaining - 1;
    };

    return true
}
```

Everything I have shared with you is correct code, use it as an example for the code I will ask you to write. To make it clear, let me describe further what is wrong and what is right.

Remember that Move does not have negative integers.

Remember that Move does not have overflowing or underflowing, do not rely on that. It does not have a `checked_add` function or anything like that.

Remember that return statements should not end with a semicolon. So this is correct `return false` and this is wrong `return false;`.

Conditional checks must be surrounded by parentheses and end in a semicolon. This is wrong:
```
if from_x != to_x && from_y != to_y {
    return false;
}
```

This is right:
```
if (from_x != to_x && from_y != to_y) {
    return false;
};
```

Other modules are named using lower case now. This is wrong:
```
Vector::borrow
```
This is right:
```
vector::borrow
```

There is no mut keyword in Move, it is not necessary.

In order to cast using `as`, you must wrap it in parentheses.

This is wrong:
```
let x = y as u64;
```
This is right:
```
let x = (y as u64);
```
